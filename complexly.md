I do freelance script-writing for Complexly, a video production company focusing on educational content for YouTube (co-owned by John and Hank Green).

### Non Fiction

I have written over 30 scripts for the YouTube channels SciShow and Crash Course. The videos have covered lots of different topics in science and engineering, with a slight emphasis on physics and physics-adjacent topics.

A full list of my videos can be found [here]({% link complexly.md %})

I'm Ricky, a post-doctoral researcher at a London university, using machine-learning (mostly computer vision techniques) in environmental health research. If reading "using machine learning to..." makes you roll your eyes, you can give my [research]({% link research.md %}) page a little look to confirm (or not) your suspicions about me being another deep-learning, bandwagon-jumping hack. My PhD was in theoretical particle physics, during which time I also started [writing popular science]({% link writing.md %}). Most notably, I've written for the popular YouTube channels SciShow and Crash Course. A short story I wrote (Beam Therapy) was published in a collection, which you can read [for free](https://shorts.quantumlah.org/the-book).
