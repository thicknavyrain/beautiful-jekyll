I have been a popular science writer (a little bit of journalism and blogging but overwhelmingly, script writing for videos) since 2015. In my free time, I sporadically write fiction, some of which has been in other publications.

## Non Fiction

### Videos (Script writing)

I have written over 30 scripts for the YouTube channels SciShow and Crash Course. The videos have covered lots of different topics in science and engineering, with a slight emphasis on physics and physics-adjacent topics. They have collectively garnered over 2.5 million views.

A full list of my videos can be found [here]({% link complexly.md %})

### Journalism and Blogging

I spent two months out from my PhD with The Naked Scientists in Cambridge a radio show produced for BBC Cambridgeshire and released as a podcast online. I wrote 8 news articles, presented 7 pieces all of which I co-produced (including interviewing researchers) and co-produced a full 30 minute show on nuclear physics, released on BBC Cambridgeshire. All pieces are available [here](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/users/ricky-nathvani).

Between 2015 and 2016, I was also a writer on the blog Quantum Diaries covering particle physics topics in (what I hope was) an accessible format. My posts may be read [here](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/author/rnathvani/).

### Other

I wrote a piece for ThinkPostgrad on whether or not to do a PhD (found [here](https://www.thinkpostgrad.com/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-do-a-phd-a-research-students-view/)).

I also wrote a short guide to career options and advice after a (British) PhD in Physics, which you can access [here]({{ https://www.atzerothorder.com/ }}/assets/hedging_your_bets__exploring_career_options_beyond_physics___static-1.pdf)

## Fiction

Sometimes I write short stories, mostly with some kind of scientific theme to them (though not necessarily "sci-fi").

One, "Beam Therapy", was a runner-up in the Quantum Shorts competition 2017 which you can find published in their [anthology of stories](https://shorts.quantumlah.org/sites/default/files/quantum_shorts_book.pdf).
