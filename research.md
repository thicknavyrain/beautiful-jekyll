The world might seem like a complicated place but it doesn’t need to be. Angles can always be small. Things only happen at low temperatures. All potentials are quadratic and spherical cows occupy friction-less vacuums. Or at least, it’s easier to make sense of it that way sometimes.

This blog is about picking apart science and other kinds of research in (what I hope is) a simple and irreverent way (or, [at zeroth order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_approximation#Zeroth-order)).

### About me

My day job is working as a post-doctoral researcher at a London university, using machine-learning (mostly computer vision techniques) in environmental health research. If reading "using machine learning to..." makes you roll your eyes, you can give my [research]({% link research.md %}) page a little look to confirm (or not) your suspicions about me being another deep-learning, bandwagon-jumping hack. My PhD was in theoretical particle physics, during which time I also started [writing popular science]({% link writing.md %}).

As well as being as a scientist/ex-physicist, I’m an attempted writer, bibliophile, lifter of heavy objects, and board gamer.
