I have been a popular science writer (a little bit of journalism and blogging but overwhelmingly, script writing for videos) since 2015.

## Non Fiction


### Videos (Script writing)

I have written over 30 scripts for the YouTube channels SciShow and Crash Course. The videos have covered lots of different topics in science and engineering, with a slight emphasis on physics and physics-adjacent topics. They have collectively garnered over 2.5 million views.

A full list of my videos can be found [here]({% link complexly.md %})

### Journalism and Blogging

I spent two months out from my PhD with The Naked Scientists in Cambridge a radio show produced for BBC Cambridgeshire and released as a podcast online. I wrote 8 news articles, presented 7 pieces all of which I co-produced (including interviewing researchers) and co-produced a full 30 minute show on nuclear physics, released on BBC Cambridgeshire. All pieces are available [here](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/users/ricky-nathvani).

Between 2015 and 2016, I was also a writer on the blog Quantum Diaries covering particle physics topics in (what I hope was) an accessible format. My posts may be read [here](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/author/rnathvani/).
