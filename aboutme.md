The world might seem like a complicated place but it doesn’t need to be. Angles can always be small. Things only happen at low temperatures. All potentials are quadratic and spherical cows occupy friction-less vacuums. Or at least, it’s easier to make sense of it that way sometimes.

This blog is about picking apart science and other kinds of research in (what I hope is) a simple and irreverent way (or, [at zeroth order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_approximation#Zeroth-order)).

### About me

Ingredients: Nitrogen (3%), Hydrogen (10%), Carbon (18%), Oxygen (65%), Preservatives. Warning: May contain traces of bone and nuts.

I'm Ricky, a post-doctoral researcher at a London university, using machine-learning (mostly computer vision techniques) in environmental health research. If reading "using machine learning to..." makes you roll your eyes, you can give my [research]({% link research.md %}) page a little look to confirm (or not) your suspicions about me being another deep-learning, bandwagon-jumping hack. My PhD was in theoretical particle physics, during which time I also started [writing popular science]({% link writing.md %}). Most notably, I've written for the popular YouTube channels SciShow and Crash Course. A short story I wrote (Beam Therapy) was published in a collection, which you can read [for free](https://shorts.quantumlah.org/the-book).

As well as being as a scientist/ex-physicist, I’m an attempted writer, bibliophile, lifter of heavy objects, and board gamer. I tweet infrequently from @ThickNavyRain.

### This website and your privacy

This website is hosted on Github pages using Jekyll and I've made every effort to turn off any feature that would track or otherwise collect data about you. I can't make promises on Github's behalf but for my part, this website shouldn't, in any way, extract any data from you you don't want it to. The corollary to this is, I have absolutely no readership statistics, so if you read something on this website please [drop me a line]({% link contact.md %}) (it takes less than a minute and you can do so anonymously).
